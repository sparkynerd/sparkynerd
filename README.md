I’m taking “world” as in the whole universe. Also when I rule the world, the year wouldn’t be this year, meaning it will be many decades (or even centuries) in the future, MEANING, the technology will be 100 times better. If I ruled the world, I would give everyone their own planet. I’m just kidding, but I would have the option for people to travel to other planets, if they are safe, of course. If we move to another planet, I’ll make sure the planet isn’t dramatically affected by pollution and stuff like that. I’d also try to stop global warming. According to a random quote from Wikipedia,
 “Global warming usually refers to human-induced warming of the Earth system, whereas climate change can refer to natural or anthropogenic change. The two terms are often used interchangeably.”
 Did you understand that? I didn’t. If we move to another planet, global warming may not be there, but don’t be so sure. Remember, it’s wikipedia. In fact, my friend edited	Wikipedia just to say that something happened to refrigerators, so, that’s the type of people who edit it. Ending this, just remember, I won’t be ruling the world, probably for the greater good.
